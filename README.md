## Instructions

With [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com), open the app's URL:

<!-- On Hashbase: `dat://p2p-photos-taravancil.hashbase.io` -->

Raw URL: `dat://6863cc95149edd256b955af4d5d7adfc282a8ddb7e0cebf6544c7940e37e15cb/`

All photos are stored locally on your device, and are only ever visible to 
people with whom you share the album's secret URL.

This peer to peer website can be used in 3 three ways.

 - You can fork this site, to create your own album generator and photo sharing page.
 - You can use this site to create a private photo album, which will be a new Dat site hosted on your local machine.
 - You can view the public photo albums on this site.
